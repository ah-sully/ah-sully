# ðŸ‘‹ Hey There, 

I build **software that just works**â€”whether itâ€™s games, mobile apps, web apps, full-stack projects, or 3D printing tools. My focus? **Performance, simplicity, and maintainability**â€”because the best software doesnâ€™t need constant babysitting.  

When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m designing **3D graphics**, making **YouTube devlogs**, or ranting about **tech, web design, and animation**. Also, I like **memes, cats, and parkour** (not necessarily in that order).  

## **What I Do**  
- **Software Development** â†’ Full-stack, games, mobile, and desktop apps.  
- **3D Design & Printing** â†’ Functional models & CGI.  
- **Content Creation** â†’ Devlogs, deep-dives, and creative experiments.  

## **Philosophy**  
- **Minimalism** 
- **Performance** 
- **Functional Programming** 
- **Best Tool for the Job** â†’ No hype-driven development.  

Thanks for stopping by. Letâ€™s build something cool. ðŸš€
